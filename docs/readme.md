# Smart Weather Station

## Overview

This project is a Smart Weather Station built using PlatformIO. It collects and displays real-time weather data using various sensors and microcontrollers.

## Features

- Temperature, humidity, and pressure monitoring
- Real-time data display
- Data logging capabilities
- Modular and extensible design
- API configuration for remote data access
- Localization support for multiple languages and regions

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, Arduino)
- DHT22 or similar temperature/humidity sensor
- BMP280 or similar pressure sensor
- Display module 

## Software Requirements

- PlatformIO IDE
- Required libraries (see `platformio.ini`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install PlatformIO and required libraries.
3. Connect the hardware components as described in the documentation.
4. Build and upload the firmware to your microcontroller.

### API Setup

To enable remote data access, configure the API settings in the firmware or configuration files. Refer to the documentation for details on setting API endpoints, authentication, and data formats.

### Localization

The weather station supports localization. You can set your preferred language and region in the configuration files to display data in your local format. See the documentation for supported languages and instructions.

## Usage

Once uploaded, the weather station will begin collecting and displaying sensor data. Refer to the documentation for advanced configuration and troubleshooting.
